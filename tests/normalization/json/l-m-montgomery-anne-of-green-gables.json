But we can’t have things perfect in this imperfect world, as \nMrs.\n Lynde says. \nMrs.\n Lynde isn’t exactly a comforting person sometimes, but there’s no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the Queen’s class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby are just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their ambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets through, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote her whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for teaching, but a husband won’t pay you anything, and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks from mournful experience, for \nMrs.\n Lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings.

I hope it isn’t wicked of me, Marilla, but really the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh.

    "expected": "<<But, oh, Marilla, I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of death, as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go out alone,>> she said mournfully that night. <<I thought how splendid it would have been if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance, too. But we cant have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs. Lynde says. Mrs. Lynde isnt exactly a comforting person sometimes, but theres no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the Queens class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby are just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their ambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets through, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote her whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for teaching, but a husband wont pay you anything, and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks from mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings.
