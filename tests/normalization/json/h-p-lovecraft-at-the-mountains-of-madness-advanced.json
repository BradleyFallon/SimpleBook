The fifth aeroplane, which we had left at the McMurdo Sound supply cache with Sherman and two sailors, was in good shape and ready for instant use, and it seemed that the very emergency for which it had been saved was now upon us.",

For this point, then, we first headed in the lightened plane as we embarked on our flight of discovery.",
